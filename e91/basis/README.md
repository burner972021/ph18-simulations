# Alternate basis simulations

Each simulation already includes a noise variable, `eta`. The default value is set to 45 degrees($\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians), but they may be configured just like with the normal 3-basis system.

We have analysed up to 6 angles for our report. Findings and detailed notes will be recorded in main/report, or possibly deposited here in the future.
