# Ekert-91 variant simulations

Language: python

External dependencies: numpy, random

There is also a library `e91lib.py`, which contains some helper functions I wrote for the simulations. 

## Content

`basis` contains simulations involving alternate measurement bases(3, 4, 5, 6 have been implemented thus far).

`models` contain base simulations I wrote at the beginning. It contains variants of the base case E91 with 3 measurement angles.

`model-devs` contains simulations and some data for calculating & plotting the deviations of error margins, as well as the key rates, with or without noise.
