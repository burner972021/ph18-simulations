# ph18-simulations

Ekert-91 and various other protocols' simulations/data analysis/etc. For CenTaD PH18

## Yet another QKD simulation in Python

### 1. Research Scope

Most work done on current discrete-variable quantum key distribution variables assume datasets that approach infinity. However, that is not practical in real life settings. We would like to investigate the effects of a finite-sized dataset, as well as the effects of an eavesdropper on this data, We would like to find the acceptable range of measured Bell's inequality values calculated from finite data sets, and how they deviate from the assumed ideal values.
