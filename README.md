## What's this?

### Research hypothesis

We hypothesise that continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems, which rely on coherent states and Gaussian modulation of light beams rather than discrete photons, may be vulnerable to beam-splitting attacks in the presence of realistic detector imperfections. 


While existing studies often assume ideal homodyne or heterodyne detectors, practical implementations may suffer from efficiency mismatches, excess noise, or bandwidth limitations. These imperfections could obscure the signatures of certain attacks, allowing an adversary to mount successful eavesdropping strategies that would otherwise be detectable. Our research aims to model and analyze how such detector flaws affect the detectability of beam-splitting-based attacks and to assess the resulting impact on the security of CV-QKD protocols.
